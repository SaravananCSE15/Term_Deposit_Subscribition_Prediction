# Objective
This project aims to develop a predictive model to enhance the marketing 
efforts of Banco de Portugal by determining whether clients will subscribe 
to a term deposit based on historical campaign data. Banks often face 
challenges in engaging clients effectively, managing vast amounts of data, 
and predicting client behavior, making predictive accuracy crucial for 
successful marketing campaigns. Using a dataset of 45,211 instances and 16 
features related to client demographics, campaign details, and previous 
campaign outcomes, this project involves comprehensive data exploration, 
feature engineering, and model development. The primary objective is to 
build a machine learning classification model that can accurately predict a 
binary outcomeâ€”whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit or not. 
The model's performance will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, 
precision, recall, and F1-score, and the results will be documented to provide 
insights for optimizing future marketing campaigns at Banco de Portugal. 
The exclusion of the "duration" feature ensures that the model can make 
realistic predictions based on information available before the final contact 
with clients
